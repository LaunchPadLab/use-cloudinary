# use-cloudinary

A hook to simplify direct upload calls to the [cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#uploading_with_a_direct_call_to_the_api).

<!-- TODO: add example and docs -->

Implemented with [useAsyncFn](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useAsyncFn.md) from `react-use`.
